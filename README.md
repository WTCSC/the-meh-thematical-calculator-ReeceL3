# 🧮 Sarcastic Math Calculator

Welcome to the **most unenthusiastic calculator ever written in Python**.  
This calculator can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers… but don’t expect it to be *excited* about it.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (3.x recommended).
2. Save the code into a file, for example:

   ```bash
   math_calculator.py
3. Run it from your terminal
    ```bash
    python math_calculator.py

## 📋 Usage

When you run the program, it will greet you (begrudgingly) and give you a menu:
1. Addition (ugh, so original)
2. Subtraction (wow, thrilling)
3. Multiplication (math party!)
4. Division (sure, why not)
5. Quit (finally)

* Choose an option by typing the number.
* Enter two numbers when asked.
* If you try dividing by zero, the calculator will roast you.
* If you type nonsense, it’ll complain.
